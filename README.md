# Coin to USD Converter â€“ Java Mini Project

A simple Java console program that takes an input of coins and converts it into US dollars using a fixed value.

##  What the program does

1. Prompts the user to enter an amount of coins.
2. Converts the input from a `String` to a `double`.
3. Multiplies the number of coins by a fixed USD exchange rate (`0.0045`).
4. Outputs the calculated USD value to the console.

Example:
Input: 100
Output: 0.45

## What I learned

- Using the `Scanner` class to get user input from the console
- Converting a `String` to a `double` using `Double.parseDouble()`
- Declaring and using variables in Java
- Performing basic arithmetic operations (multiplication)
- Outputting information using `System.out.println()`
- Understanding the basic structure of a Java program (`main()` method, class declaration, etc.)
